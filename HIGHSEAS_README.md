# portfolio-website

This is a developer portfolio website I created that showcases my skills and projects I have developed. I created this site using SvelteKit, a framework for building web applications.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and work well on all devices.
- **Contact Form**: The contact form allows users to send me a message directly from the website.
- **Dynamic Hero Section**: The hero section of the website changes in real-time through a simulated typing effect
